 PCB:
	-Debugwire
		-final goal for programming is with usb via dfu so debugwire in not needed also if debugwire fuse is activated then reset is deactivated so SPI in not working
		-remove DWIRE pins

	-SPI
		-add SPI classical 3x2 pinout for easier fuse setting up

	-Profile button
		-wrong connection on pin 1 with GND that couses the button to be permanetly pressed
		-bounces like crazy so might add capacitor between pin 4 and GND
		-pin 4 needs to be connected to PD7/HWB to use the HWBE fuse to get to bootloader
		-to close to switches

	-USB-C
		-Was nightmare to solder becouse pads were too close together (make pads thinner)

	-ATMEGA16U2
		-missing connections between VCC, UVCC and AVCC
		-pads could be thinner to make soldering easier
		-reset pin is missing 10k pullup rezistor

	-Pogo pins
		-Make pads longer for easier soldering
		-Put them closer to the edge

	-Leds
		-Switches have dedicated seetrought part for leds to shine
		-Put the leds under this part (make south-facing switches)
		-One of the rows are connected to wrong pin both need to be on timer/counter0 (PB7/0C0A and PD0/0C0B)
	
	-Mounting holes
		-Top left one need to be moved higher to make room for magnet next to pogo pins

	-Switches
		-Big middle hole needs to be bigger by like 0.15 mm




Code:
	-Effect 3 (breathing)
		-Sometimes leds are blinking really fast
		-problem is coused by changing the brightness with other effects. The delta is than in the wrong cycle and insted of cycling between
		 min and max its overflowing and hitting min or max from "other side"
		-Is fixed by reseting the device or just switching few times between effects
	-Effect 1 (off)
		-is not really off but rather minimum brightness (but is kinda nice bacouse I can tell if it't in bootloader)
