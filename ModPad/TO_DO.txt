Board firmware
	-Make the board firmware so that the matrix functions doesn't have to write directly to registers and be pin dipendent
	lsb usb
Makefiles
	-Figure out how to put make file in each folder to make compiling easier

More light effects
	-wawe

Effect for usb events

Use bootloader
	-I would be good to find a bootloader for atmega16u2 but the older one for at90usb162 will do for now

Add 16bit media keys

Better key codes
	-there are starting to be too many different "types" of key codes so it might be necessery to put a identifier to each keycode
	-that mean putting each key code in to struct with key code value and identifier (global, consumer,key modifier, effent, effect modifier, event)

Second interface for module

Make a power-down sequence
	-will probably need v2 pcb for that
	-uses a brown-out detection (BOD) to detect a voltage drop and run interrupt
	-saving to eeprom

Macro keys
	- Be able to send macros (button combos)
