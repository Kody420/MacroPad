	ModPad
Board firmware
	-Make the board firmware so that the matrix functions doesn't have to write directly to registers and be pin dipendent
	lsb usb
Makefiles
	-Figure out how to put make file in each folder to make compiling easier

More light effects
	-wawe

Effect for usb events

Find corrent bootloader
	-I would be good to find a bootloader for atmega16u2 but the older one for at90usb162 will do for now

Use any key code with any page
	-Generic keyboard key codes are capped at 0xB1

Better key codes
	-there are starting to be too many different "types" of key codes so it might be necessery to put a identifier to each keycode
	-that mean putting each key code in to struct with key code value and identifier (global, consumer,key modifier, effent, effect modifier, event)

Macro keys
	- Be able to send macros (button combos)


	Sliders
Fix unstable ADC
	-Could use more samples to smooth it out
	-Measure AVCC and sliding potenciometrs accurately

Turn off leds in effect 4 (Slider position activated)
	-Write 0 to brightness array for leds that are not lit
